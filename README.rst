==================
Flake8 Alphabetize
==================

Alphabetize is a `Flake8 <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`_ plugin for checking the
order of ``import`` statements, the ``__all__`` list and ``except`` lists. It is
designed to work well with the
`Black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_ formatting tool, in that
Black never alters the
`Abstract Syntax Tree <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree>`_ (AST),
while Alphabetize is *only* interested in the AST, and so the two tools never conflict.
In the spirit of Black, Alphabetize is an 'uncompromising import style checker' in that
the style can't be configured, there's just one style (see below for the rules).

Alphabetise is released under the `MIT-0 licence
<https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit-0/>`_. It is tested on Python 3.7+.

Installation
------------

1. Create a virtual environment: ``python3 -m venv venv``

#. Activate it: ``source venv/bin/activate``

2. Install: ``pip install flake8-alphabetize``


Examples
--------

Say we have a Python file ``myfile.py``:

.. code:: python

   from datetime import time, date

   print(time(9, 39), date(2021, 4, 11))


by running the command ``flake8`` we'll get::

   myfile.py:1:1: AZ200 Imported names are in the wrong order. Should be date, time

We can tell Alphabetize what the package name is, and then it'll know that its imports
should be in a group at the bottom of the imports. Here's an example:

.. code:: python

   import uuid

   from myapp import myfunc

   print(uuid.UUID4(), myfunc())


by running the command ``flake8 --application-names myapp`` we won't get any errors.


Usage
-----

As you use Flake8 in the normal way, Alphabetize will report errors using the following
codes:

.. table:: Error Codes

   +-------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Code  | Error Type                                                     |
   +=======+================================================================+
   | AZ100 | Import statements are in the wrong order                       |
   +-------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
   | AZ200 | The names in the ``import from`` are in the wrong order        |
   +-------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
   | AZ300 | Two ``import from`` statements must be combined.               |
   +-------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
   | AZ400 | The names in the ``__all__`` are in the wrong order            |
   +-------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
   | AZ500 | The names in the exception handler list are in the wrong order |
   +-------+----------------------------------------------------------------+

Alphabetize follows the Black formatter's uncompromising approach and so there's only
one configuration option which is ``application-names``. This is a comma-separated list
of top-level, package names that are to be treated as application imports, eg. 'myapp'.
Since Alphabetize is a Flake8 plugin, this configuration option is set using
`Flake8 configuration <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html>`_.


Pre-Commit Configuration
------------------------

Alphabetize can be easily configured to run in your existing
`pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com>`_ hooks, as an additional dependency of Flake8:

.. code:: YAML

   repos:
      - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8
        rev: 6.0.0
        hooks:
         - id: flake8
           additional_dependencies: ['flake8-alphabetize']
      
      

Rules Of Import Ordering
------------------------

Here are the ordering rules that Alphabetize follows:

1. The special case ``from __future__`` import comes first.

#. Imports from the standard library come next, followed by third party imports,
   followed by application imports.

#. Relative imports are assumed to be application imports.

#. The standard library group has ``import`` statements first (in alphabetical order),
   followed by ``from import`` statements (in alphabetical order).

#. The third party group is further grouped by library name. Then each library subgroup
   has ``import`` statements first (in alphabetical order), followed by ``from import``
   statements (in alphabetical order).

#. The application group is further grouped by import level, with absolute imports first
   and then relative imports of increasing level. Within each level, the imports should
   be ordered by library name. Then each library subgroup has ``import`` statements
   first (in alphabetical order), followed by ``from import`` statements (in
   alphabetical order).

#. ``from import`` statements for the same library must be combined.

#. Alphabetize only looks at imports at the module level, any imports within the code
   are ignored.


Running Tests
-------------

Run `tox <https://tox.wiki/en/latest/>`_ to run the tests.

* Install tox: ``pip install tox``
* Run tox: ``tox``


OpenSSF Scorecard
-----------------

It might be worth running the `OpenSSF Scorecard <https://securityscorecards.dev/>`_::

  sudo docker run -e GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=<auth_token> gcr.io/openssf/scorecard:stable \
  --repo=github.com/tlocke/flake8-alphabetize


Doing A Release Of Alphabetize
------------------------------

Run ``tox`` to make sure all tests pass, then update the release notes, then do::

   git tag -a x.y.z -m "version x.y.z"
   rm -r dist
   python -m build
   twine upload --sign dist/*
